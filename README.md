lpthw is a repository that I'm doing as to learn git and python.

lpthw is a free online series that is authored by Zed A Shaw.
I'm currently enrolled in a 3 month mentoring course offered by Noufal Ibrahim and git and python are the basic skills that I need to efficiently complete the mentoring course.

Basically in this repository I just do all the exercises mentioned in
the http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html and have one file
per exercise.  Whenever there is a need for modification or other
things to try out, I just edit these files and add them as new commits.
